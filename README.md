# Amazon-Purchase-Automater
Automating amazon purchase using a spreadsheet to gather the total price before and after tax before making the final purchase
Caution:
1. Sometimes the link gathering process would break due to Amazon presents their item links inconsistently in their SERP, makes it difficult to locate element using Selenium with my knowledge (not the sharpest tool in the shed)
2. Sometimes the code would have a hard time locate the delete button for the shopping cart for the same reason as above, might provide total cart value instead of individual item value
